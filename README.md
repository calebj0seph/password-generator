## About
Password Generator is a web app that generates random passwords inside your
browser. Features include:
* Passwords never leave your device — all data stays in your browser and no
  network requests are made.
* Password generation using cryptographically secure randomness. By using
  [`Crypto.getRandomValues()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/getRandomValues)
  as the source of randomness, generated passwords are impossible to predict or
  manipulate.
* Different options to control how passwords are generated, including number of
  digits, number of symbols, and which symbols to use.

Password Generator is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and
[Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).
